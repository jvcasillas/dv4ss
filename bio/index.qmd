Most of his research is conducted on bilinguals of varying proficiency and linguistic experience. 
Some of his recent projects have centered on native phonetic experience and its influence on L2 speech production, perception and lexical processing. 
He also focuses his time and attention on coding, statistical analysis, data visualization, and reproducible research, as well as training researchers to implement open research practices in the speech sciences, particularly in Bilingualism/Second Language Acquisition research. 
He also enjoys playing music, Casio watches, and anything related to el andal√∫.
